# financial-markets-in-Java

Collections of useful operations for financial markets in Java.

1) Analytic forulas and useful operations on matrices and vectors
- useful operations on matrices and vector: Enables often used operation like append, cbind, rbind or min max on vectors and matrices. Furthermore the code enables
more complex operations like transpose and inverse.
-Analytic formulas in the context of financial markets: Enables for example the use of the black scholes and the bachelier formula for options. 
Furthermore I added a test class in order to demonstrate how to use the methods.

2) Automatic backward differentiation
The clss performs the Automatic backward differentiation algorithm, i.e. diverentiate equations. The class RandomVariable enables the use of vectors. 
Furthermore I added a test class in order to demonstrate how to use the methods in the context of calculating derivatives and also by calcualting 
option deltas using the derivaive.
